Routine Description:

  Initialize a basic mutual exclusion lock.   Each lock
  provides mutual exclusion access at it's task priority
  level.  Since there is no-premption (at any TPL) or
  multiprocessor support, acquiring the lock only consists
  of raising to the locks TPL.

  Note on a debug build the lock is acquired and released
  to help ensure proper usage.
    
Arguments:

  Lock        - The FLOCK structure to initialize

  Priority    - The task priority level of the lock

    
Returns:

  An initialized F Lock structure.

Routine Description:

  Raising to the task priority level of the mutual exclusion

Arguments:

  Lock        - The lock to acquire
    
Returns:

Routine Description:

  Releases ownership of the mutual exclusion lock, and

Returns:
